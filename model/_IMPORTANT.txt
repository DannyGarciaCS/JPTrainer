The model uses the ETL Character Database. In accordance with ETL's conditions of use, I cannot provide the data used.

If you want to tweak or rebuild the model used, follow the following steps:
1. Go to http://etlcdb.db.aist.go.jp/download-request, request access to the data, and download it.
2. Go to http://etlcdb.db.aist.go.jp/download-request and follow the instructions to extract the images.
3. Move the generated folders (ETL1 - ETL9G) into the "images" folder
4. Run the buildModel.py script
